Ok, so after some thoughts, I decided to make the same program in C#.
I like challenges, and I have never programmed in C#, so I basically
used the same design as I used in the Python version, to save time and to see
what differences I could find.

This is what I found.

NAMESPACE
#########
    Python: I usually gather several classes into one file, and then that file would
            pretty much be the namespace when importing it to other programs.
    Csharp: In C# it seems to be pretty common to have one file for each class.
            Then by using the namespace, we know what files belong together.


NAME EXTENSION
##############
-   C# has this cool function in a Path namespace that I found.
    I will explain the differences between Python and C#.

    Python: In python to fetch the name, I remove the file itself, with the
            extension, from the path itself.
            After that I remove the extension from the file name.
    Csharp: In C#, I can remove the name itself, without the extension, with
            a built in function in the Path namespace.
            That was pretty cool.


GET SET
#######
-   Noticed that C# is using get; set; in the same function instead of the
    regular getters and setters from other programming languages, such as Java.
