Ok, so after some thoughts, I decided to make the same program in C#.
I like challenges, and I have never programmed in C#, so I basically
used the same design as I used in the Python version, to save time and to see
what differences I could find.

This is what I found.

NAMESPACE
#########
    Python: I usually gather several classes into one file, and then that file would
            pretty much be the namespace when importing it to other programs.
    Csharp: In C# it seems to be pretty common to have one file for each class.
            Then by using the namespace, we know what files belong together.


NAME EXTENSION
##############
-   C# has this cool function in a Path namespace that I found.
    I will explain the differences between Python and C#.

    Python: In python to fetch the name, I remove the file itself, with the
            extension, from the path itself.
            After that I remove the extension from the file name.
    Csharp: In C#, I can remove the name itself, without the extension, with
            a built in function in the Path namespace.
            That was pretty cool.


GET SET
#######
-   Noticed that C# is using get; set; in the same function instead of the
    regular getters and setters from other programming languages, such as Java.


COUNT WORDS
###########
-   Initially, it seems like the counting of words does not happen
    as automatically as it does in Python.
-   The program is currently not catching words that have special characters
    around the word
-   So, I found another function called "Contains" instead of using "Equals".
    Equals will compare the strings straight up while Contains will check if the 
    string contains the word that we are looking for.
