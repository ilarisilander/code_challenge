INSTRUCTIONS
############
-   I wrote the application in Python since that's my main language and I was recommended to do so.
-   Will try to do it in C# or F# also (haven't really programmed in those languages before).


REQUIREMENTS
############
"Write a console program that takes one argument, a path to a file.
Open that file and count how many times its filename (minus the file extension) occurs in the file's contents.
Example: If the argument is "myfile.txt" it should count how many times the string "myfile" occurs in it."


Input args:
-   Should it be able to take more than .txt files?
    My assumption and decision is to only use .txt files.

-   The validator should validate for capital letters also

-   What should happen if there is no argument when executed?
    This is handled by the arg parser with the "required" option

-   If there is more than one argument?


Word search:
-   If the name of the file is foot.txt, it doesn't clarifiy in the instructions if these count as a "hit":
    "foot" -> character before and after the actual word. Could be ' and () also.
    football -> word is a part of another word
    foot. -> word has a trailing symbol. Could be ! . , : or any other symbol.
    Foot/FOOT -> capital/lower letters and so on...
    
    My assumption is that all hits will be detected.
    This could be a bit tricky to fully test. Might have to think about that


Path:
-   Should it work with a relative path or only full path?

-   Some systems have / in path and some have \ and I need to handle both.

Test cases:
-   If possible, I like to write my unit tests without any file dependencies, but for this one
    I will use a word_file.txt as a test file instead of hard coding the input.
    At least for now.
